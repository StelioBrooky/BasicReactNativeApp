# Reptile Resource NZ

Kia ora!

This here is a university project that I had completed in 2022 after a couple of weeks. The project was to create an app using React Native. The purpose of this app is to have a basic implementation of a database (in this case, I used firebase) to show a list of pet reptiles that you own. The database works as expected. Also a basic security check is implemented through a login with a username and password. In the future, I would go to use Firebase Auth for later projects for better more hidden authentication. 

As this was my first time writing in JavaScript for the react native framework, it has a pretty basic UX design, however included into this repository is the photos of the wireframes I had planned for ideal user experience for what would be the final app.
